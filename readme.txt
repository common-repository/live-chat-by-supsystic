= Do You Need Live Chat Software? =

Do you sell products or services on your WordPress website and how do you provide fast access to product support?

One downside of selling online compared to running a physical store is that you don’t have a staff of people trained to walk up to each customer and answer questions. If someone virtually walks into your online store there are no sales or customer service representatives to help and support people navigate through your site or guide them to a desired product or service. [Supsystic Live Chat](http://supsystic.com/plugins/live-chat "Live Chat WordPress plugin") is live chat software plugin. Allows you to talk with your website visitors. Our live chat plugin is the most scalable and flexible Live Chat for wordpress websites.

Luckily we create onlive live chat support plugin that give your customers a live chat popup screen to connect directly with someone who knows more.

 * Live chat is an important feature. For example 56% of respondents to their study have chatted once on a company’s website. and 49% prefer to talk with a live chat agent during the purchase. The same study concluded that 39% used live chat more than once.
 * Live chat increases sales. As humans, we always look for good advice. It is a strange thing, but we do trust advices from the seller and if those sellers give you good advice in live chat, you tend to go back to them more often. Live chat allows you to build a relationship with your customers.
 * Live chat is light on budget. If you compare live chat and phone calls, chatting is much more affordable. Unlike call agents, chat personnel can handle multiple clients at the same time in Live Chat.
